# VSCode
> Seamless Visual Studio Code Integration in Unity

## Installation
It is important to make sure that the `VSCode.cs` file is placed under the `Assets/Plugins/Editor` folder in the project. If you already have `SimpleJSON.cs` already in the project you do not need to worry about copying it over, however if you don't, you are going to need to make sure that it finds its way over to somewhere under the `Assets/Plugins` folder.

> The dependency on [SimpleJSON](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SimpleJSON "SimpleJSON @ wiki.unity3d.com") will be removed in an upcoming version of Unity

## Usage
Once the VSCode files are in place, simply navigate your way to the `Assets | VS Code` menu and select the `Enable Integration` option. A check mark will appear beside the option, indicating that its active.

That's it! Your ready to go!
